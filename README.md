# In the Mix R-Scripts 

These are R script files from a thesis project that examined the role of biracial actors on friendship diversity within two racially/ethnically diverse secondary schools in the United States. This project utilized static network models (via exponential random graph models), dynamic network models (via RSiena), and Linert's Colored Triad Census to assess brokerage structures and related network theories on friendship diversity.
